Pump control with Csharp Applicaiton 

Pump Cycle Upgrade
Ryan Hutchinson
Spring 2016
1 Objective
Modify or create software that allows users to control 8-10 pumps through user given cycles.
2 Inital Ideas
1. Best Approach will be to leave the program the way it is and add on to it. The program might be
complete but it is very unorganized and hard to follow what the ideas were behind the decision making
process. Initial ideas are as follows:
(a) Create a Master Clock
i. 1 main clock
ii. Actions will happen along the main clock
iii. Actions will be created by user (Example: Turn Pump on at 70ml/min @ 12h:26m(From
start))
(b) Pump Specific Schedule
i. Each Pump will be scheduled individually
ii. Can have Pump cycles predefined (Example: laundry cycle, shower cycle, etc.)
iii. will need to have the abilty to create custom cycles for unknown circumstances
2. ALL Ideas will have manual override or the ability to control specific pumps. Decision needs to be
made on if a feature is needed that will be able to choose if cycle will continue as scheduled or you
will create a new schedule for it.
3 Time
Biggest time commitment will not be in working on Labview itself. The largest time commitment will be
working out the logic of the program followed by testing and debugging of decided logic. The easiest way to
test all the logic is to speed up time. This is another feature that can be decided on. The ability to run through
a full cylce in minutes instead of hours. Great way to see what will happen over the time that user will not be
present to make sure the logic is acting correctly in minutes instead of hours. A set amount of time is hard
to determine but from what has been seen so far I put the work at about 15 hours. Again the majority of the
time will be in testing and tweaking becuase of the severity of a failure.
